# Motivation

About 5 years ago I started programming in Python. By that time I had already 15
years of programming experience. After working with Clipper and Pascal, going
through Java and strong object orientation skills, it was time to start with
something different.

To have a fresh start and not get lost in all books and internet content, I
decided to go straight to the source: www.python.org. The site on itself was
amazing and full of content: from basic tutorials to an extensive library about
Python as a programming language and its APIs.

So, I had the source and the willingness, but how would I structure the whole
learning process? I then decided to write samples! Yes, that would be the best
way to get examples and references in a project. In addition, I could add
documentation to the source code itself and also make it available to other
people: experienced or beginners with CS and Python. The examples are simple,
but they let you know what has to be done and why.

After 2 weeks I got what you can find in this repository. I hope you like it and
it can somehow helpful you in your pursuit for Python experience.

# Project Structure
* src/nl/ekholabs/sample/python
  * hello.py
    * Contains simple things like: variable assignments; docstrings; printing to the terminal; conditions; etc.
  * format
    * textFormat.py
      * Contains a bit more interesting things, like: loops; message formatting; functions; math constants; etc.
